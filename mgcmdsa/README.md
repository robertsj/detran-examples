# Multigroup Diffusion Preconditioners for Multiplying, Fixed-Source Transport Problems

This folder contains scripts and notebooks that reproduce, to the degree possible, 
the results shown in 

    J. Roberts and B. Forget, "Multigroup Diffusion Preconditioners for 
    Multiplying, Fixed-Source Transport Problems, " *Journal of Computational 
    Physics Volume* **274**, 1 October 2014, Pages 455-472

The original paper leveraged PETSc for its solvers and preconditioners.  Here, 
only the built-in tools are used for easier replication.
